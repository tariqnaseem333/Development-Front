Step 1: We need to mention the BrowserRouter in the index.js. The BrowserRouter component takes only one child. Therefore we will place the <App/> inside the BrowserRouter, as shown below:

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
import App from "./App";
ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
  , document.getElementById('root'));
 

Step 2: Typically the App should only have the various Routes and things common to all components, like a navbar. We will place the <Route> inside the <Switch>. This ensures that the first matching route is taken. Replace the App.js with the code shown below:

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Route, Redirect, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import EditEmployee from './components/EditEmployee';
import Card from './components/Card';
 
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" render={() => (<Redirect to="/card" />)} />
          <Route path="/card" component={Card} />    
          <Route path="/edit/:id" component={EditEmployee} />
        </Switch>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
