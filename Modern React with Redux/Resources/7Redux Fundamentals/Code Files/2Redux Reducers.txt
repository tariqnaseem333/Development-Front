For example,

// can be present in reducers.js file
​​​​import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
 
const initialBookState = { accountBooks: 666666 };
 
//creating a single reducer which can change the accountBooks present in initialBookState 
export const bookReducer = (initialState = initialBookState.accountBooks, action) => {
    
    switch(action.type){
        case 'BORROW':
            let newBooksBal = initialState - action.qty;
            return newBooksBal;
        case 'RETURN':
            let newBooksBal = initialState + (-(-action.qty));
            return newBooksBal;
        default: 
            return initialState;              
    }
};
//combining all the reducers to a single libraryReducers
export const libraryReducers = combineReducers({accountBooks: bookReducer });
