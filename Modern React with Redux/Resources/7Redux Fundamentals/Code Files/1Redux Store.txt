creating a redux store: Demo
Store is created by using the createStore() method. The createStore() method needs to be imported from Redux, and it takes a single reducer as parameter. We generally pass root reducer as parameter to the createStore() method.

// Below code can be present in store.js file
import { createStore } from 'redux';
//initial state 
export const initialBookState = {
    accountBooks: 666666
}
//reducer config
export const libraryReducers; //all the reducers combined
 
//store config
export function configureStore(){
    const store = createStore( bookReducers, initialBookState ); 
    return store;
}
export const bookStore = configureStore();
